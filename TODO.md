Previous rhetoric from readme:
```
## Why?
- **You constantly screw things up.** You are a learner and/or hacker. [Debugging](http://lmgtfy.com/) an OS always sucks. Just ``reset --hard HEAD`` instead.
- **Your computer was just stolen.** You just need to get up and running -- you're not a *(necessarily)* quitter.

In any of these scenarios, it's very common for people to do something along these lines, in no specific order:

- Download applications as they remember what apps they used to have.
- Setup command line tools willy-nilly, unless they had maintained some [.dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/).
